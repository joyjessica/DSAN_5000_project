## Breaking the Cycle: Key Findings and Takeaways

High school dropout rates have a profound impact on students, families, and communities. To bring these numbers down, we first need to understand what’s driving them. This study takes a closer look at how the quality of schools and the socioeconomic challenges students face influence high school outcomes in New York City. By diving into these factors, we aim to uncover ways to help students succeed.

### Data Science Questions:
1. How does a school’s environment contribute to better student outcomes?
2. What are the most significant predictors of student absenteeism, dropout rates and college persistence?
3. What are the interactions between chronic absenteeism, dropout rates, and college persistence?
4. How does socioeconomic status impact student absenteeism, dropout rates and college persistence?
5. How can early academic indicators be used to identify schools at risk of high dropout or not persisting in college?

### Scope
1. Collect and clean data, creating a comprehensive dataset of NYC high schools
2. Perform exploratory data analysis to uncover trends in the data
3. Perform unsupervised learning and supervised learning to find real relationships between our features and targets: chronic absenteeism, dropout rates, and college persistence
4. Summarize findings into actionable insights

### Exploring the Data
This dataset contains 500 New York City public high schools. We can begin by taking a look at dropout rates across New York City Boroughs, revealing areas of needed intervention.

It is evident that the highest median drop out rate is in the Bronx, followed by Brooklyn. Although there are some high outliers in Queens. This highlights boroughs where intervention is necessary. To take a closer look, we can look at drop out rates by specific NYC school districts.

This plot clearly shows the highest drop out rate to be in district 12, which is located in the Bronx. Next is district 8 which is also located in the Bronx. This plot makes it easier to pinpoint school districts that need to be targeted.

Next, we can take a look at specific socioeconomic and school features that we hypothesize will have an impact on our targets.

Using statistical testing, we were able to conclude that there is a statistically significant difference in mean median household income for high schools with high rates of drop out and high schools with low rates of dropout. This suggests that students from higher-income households, likely with parents with degrees and employment, and are less likely to drop out themselves. This emphasizes the importance of addressing economic disparities to improve these rates.

Supportive Environment score comes from the NYC Quality report and is defined as, "reflects how well the school establishes a culture where students feel safe, challenged to grow, and supported to meet high expectations." There is a statistically significant difference in the mean supportive environment score for a school with high and low rates of chronic absenteeism. This is important because it shows that when students feel good about the school environment, and feel a sense of value and community, theyre less likely to skip class or be absent.

### Unsupervised Learning

### Supervised Learning

### Key Takeaways
* **Grade 8 Proficiency** is a crucial indicator of future success, highlighting the importance of early intervention to address academic challenges before they escalate
* **Supportive and Trusting Environments** contribute to better student outcomes, emphasizing the need for schools to create cultures where students feel safe, supported, and motivated
* **Economic Disadvantage** plays a significant role in long-term outcomes such as college persistence, with students from lower-income backgrounds facing more barriers to succes
* **The Connection:** Chronic absenteeism, dropout rates, and college persistence are closely linked. Addressing absenteeism early is key to preventing dropout and ensuring students stay on track for college success.

By identifying and understanding the key drivers, such as supportive environment and socioeconomic factors, we can develop targeted strategies to support students more effectively. Empowering schools to create safe, supportive, and inclusive environments, while addressing broader economic challenges, is essential to ensure that every student has the opportunity to succeed academically and beyond.
