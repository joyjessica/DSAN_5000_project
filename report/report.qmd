It is evident that the highest median drop out rate is in the Bronx, followed by Brooklyn. Although there are some high outliers in Queens. This highlights boroughs where intervention is necessary. To take a closer look, we can look at drop out rates by specific NYC school districts.
![](../images/graphs/districts.png){width=200 height=300}

This plot shows the clear highest drop out rate to be in district 12, which is located in the Bronx. Next is district 8 which is also located in the Bronx. This plot makes it easier to pinpoint school districts that need to be targeted.

This study highlights the need for early intervention in schools to avoid absenteeism, drop out, and increase college persistence.
